💬 Closing Note from Prof. Jasbir Singh
“It has been a pleasure guiding you through the fundamentals of Python and connecting it with real-world AI/ML applications. I have seen great curiosity, and I hope each one of you continues to explore this journey beyond syntax—into automation, data analysis, and intelligent solutions.
Remember: coding is not about remembering commands, it's about solving problems. Practice regularly, build small projects, and stay connected with open-source communities like GitHub, Kaggle, and Cisco NetAcad.
I encourage you all to try mini-projects, participate in coding contests, and even start your own GitHub repositories to track your learning.
Wishing you all a future full of learning and innovation. Keep coding, keep exploring!”
